				<h2>First lesson</h2>
				<p>

				   On the guitar the highest-sounding strings are nearest the floor, and the lowest-sounding nearest your head. The lowest-sounding string is the one closest to your head and is also the thickest string on the instrument - the low E. 

					 Moving upwards in pitch, but downwards in space, we have A, D, G, B and finally a high E. Try to memorise these pitches and their order. 

					Maybe invent a funny saying, like 'Elephants All Dine Generally Before Eight' to help you remember (I just made that up, by the way). A lot of guitar music is written down using a chart to represent the neck of the guitar. The six strings above are shown like this: 

					 What do those circles mean at the top? 

					 They tell us to play the open string. 
					Before we learn our first chord, we need to learn about frets. Frets are the vertical metal bars that run across the guitar neck underneath the strings. 

		 

					The spaces between these are named in numerical order starting from number 1, nearest the neck. 

					When you put your finger on the string to play a note, you will usually place it just behind the fret. 

					Remember this later on  - if you get the old 'beginner buzzing', chances are, one of your fingers is too far away from the fret.
